## Repository files
Within this repository, we distribute a PK-Sim project file containing simulations of all published clinical studies used to evaluate the predictive performance of our models regarding the Clarithromycin-Midazolam-DDI, including the respective observed data digitized from literature reports. For further details and documentation please refer to [[1](#reference)].
